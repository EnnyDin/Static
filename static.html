    <h1> <strong>LOST DAY</strong> </h1>
<p>This is on me.</p>
<p>I am tring to improve on this.</p>
<h>I am just going to try out some things now.</h>
<h4>This may not turn out how I expect it to</h4>
<li><em>I dont know what this does but I will do it for-</em></li>
<ol>(i)Me and I,</ol>
<ol>(ii)Myself and I,</ol>
<ol>(iii)Me vs myself,</ol>
<il>In the end I realised that I have nobody to blame but myself</il>
<p>After all was said and done it's just that it took me a minute but in the end I <strong>understood</strong> the concept being taught.</p>
